        <p>
            Chocolate is a type of candy made from cacao beans. It can be found in many different forms including bars, chips, and even drinks.
            It is often enjoyed as a treat or dessert.

        <p>
            I do like eating chocolate and things that are chocolate flavored too. Although, I do try not to eat too much of it and save it for special occasions.
