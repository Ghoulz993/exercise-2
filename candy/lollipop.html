        <p>
            Lollipops are a type of candy that consists of a hard candy mounted on a stick. There are the standard round lollipops and then there are lollipops that have
            something inside of them, like gum or chocolate, or some type of coating.

        <p>
            I do like lollipops. They were one of my favorite treats when I was a child. Nowadays, I do not really eat them.
