            Apples are one of the most popular fruits in the world. They come in a variety of colors, including red, green, and yellow.
            Apples are not only delicious but also packed with essential nutrients.

        <p>
            I do like to eat apples, but, I do not really eat them that often. There are some fruits that I would choose over apples,
            but I would not turn one down if I were hungry.
