        <p>
            Bananas are another popular choice of fruit. They are known for their bright yellow color and sweet taste.
            Often times, bananas are eaten as a quick snack due to their fiber and potassium.

        <p>
            I enjoy eating bananas, either by themselves or in a smoothie. They are something that I would usually eat if I needed
            something quick that I could finish.
